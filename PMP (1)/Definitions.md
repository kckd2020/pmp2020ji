# Stakeholder analysis
Stakeholder analysis is a technique that can assist the project team members understand the variety of stakeholders that have an interest in the project and the individual nuances that can affect project risk. In an environment where office politics often appear to cloud a projectâ€™s progression, stakeholder analysis provides the team with views and measures and that can help uncover and remove barriers.

The technique described here compels project leaders to identify and support the interests of the key groups. When interests that cannot be supported arise, the knowledge that they exist and what level of influence the stakeholder may impose can be a great asset to the project team. The difference between success and failure can be simply in knowing project advocates and opponents, understanding their respective needs and levels of influence, and aligning the project accordingly.
