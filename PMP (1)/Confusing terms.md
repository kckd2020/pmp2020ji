**Run Chart vs Control Chart for PMP Exam**
The PMBOK® Guide mentions the Seven Basic Tools of Quality for the Project Quality Management Area, these seven tools are:

BHAU - Q tools xmind
**Quality Tools** 
	Control chart
	Cause and effect (Ishikawa or Fishbone) diagram
	Flow chart
	Histogram
	Pareto diagram (based on 80-20 rule)
	Scatter diagram
	Check sheet

Although a run chart is not one of these basic quality control tools, knowing it will help you understand the control chart.

Control charts and run charts are essential tools in quality management that help you identify trends or errors in the product or the process. These charts let you know: 


- How the process is performing.
- Today’s vs. yesterday’s performance.
- Whether you are performing as planned. 


**Run Chart**
A run chart is straightforward. It shows the **variation for a single data group over time**. It helps you analyze:

Trends in the process.
If the process has shifted.
Whether or not the process has any non-random patterns. 
Small to medium-sized organizations use run charts to communicate the project’s progress with the client.

**Cricket score graph**

Benefits of Run Charts
The following are a few benefits of a run chart:


- It’s easy to draft.
- It’s easy to analyze and interpret.
- It does not require much technical skill.
- It is a straightforward representation of the data.

**Limitations of Run Charts**
The following are a few drawbacks of a run chart:

They don’t have any **statistical control limits**; they don’t show you the upper and lower tolerance and threshold limits.
Run charts cannot show you if the **process is stable** and in control.
To understand a run chart, you should know the context in which the data was collected. 

For example, you may think a trend is normal, while in fact, it was a variation. Sometimes, you may feel a trend is abnormal when it is not.

**Control Chart**
***Mr. Walter A. Shewhart*** developed this chart while working at Bell Labs; many experts call it the Shewhart chart. It helps you study changes in the process.

Elements of Control Charts
A control chart has the following elements:


- Mean
- Limits
- Specification limits

A centerline (red line) called the mean or goal is surrounded by others (dotted green lines) called limits. 
These lines are the upper control limit and lower control limit (UCL and LCL). These are again surrounded by two others (purple lines) known as the upper specification limit and lower specification limit. 

Upper and lower specification limits are provided in the contract, and you cannot cross them. These limits are determined by the project manager to set the process boundaries, and if the process goes beyond them, corrective action will be taken. 

You can say that the process is **under control if 99.73% (3-sigma) of the data points fall between the upper and lower control limits**. 

Control charts help you find answers to the following questions:
- Is the process under control?
- Is the project is moving in the right direction?
- Are the deliverables within the specification limits?

**Rule of Seven**
You might think that intervention is required the moment an observation is outside the control limits or specification limits. This is incorrect. Under one condition you will start an investigation even if the data points are within the control limits. This case is known as the “Rule of Seven.”

This rule says that ***if seven or more consecutive data points fall on one side of the mean, you should investigate***, even if these points fall within the control limits.

Usage of Control Charts
You can use control charts in the following cases:
- To find and correct an error in an ongoing process.
- To see if the process is stable.
- To analyze the pattern in the process or product output.

**Limitations of Control Charts**
Control charts show common cause and special cause variations. 
Common cause variations are normal and usually do not require intervention, while *special cause variations require attention*. 
A control chart may show you a **false special cause variation**, wasting your time and resources.
Although control charts are easy to understand, they require knowledge of *mathematical concepts*, such as mean and standard deviation, to draw the diagram. 
This chart requires skilled and trained personnel.
If the limits are placed incorrectly, you may get false indications.

**Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate vs Definitive Estimate**

What is a **Rom Estimate**?
A ROM estimate is generally completed in one of the first phases of a project. In general, when a company or business wants a ROM cost completed, they are looking for a ballpark number instead of an exact figure.

The variation between estimated and actual costs with a ROM estimate can easily be plus or minus fifty percent.

**Definitive Estimate**
The method of preparing a definitive estimate must be more detailed than a ROM estimate. In addition, there must be more solid data when preparing a definitive estimate

**Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate**: within the range of -25% to +75%
**Preliminary estimate**: within the range of -15% to +50%
**Budget estimate**: within the range of -10% to +25%
**Definitive Estimate**: within the range of -5% to +10%
**Final estimate**: 100% accurate

* * *

## **Estimating**

***Analogous estimating***	
Generally used at the start of the project when not much is known. 
Compares the current project with past similar projects. 
A quick and relatively easy method of estimating, although not terribly accurate.

***Parametric estimating***	
Used for estimates that are quantitatively based, such as dollars per square foot or number of installations per day. 
A relatively simple method, but not every activity or cost can be estimated quantitatively.

***Three-point estimating***	
Accounts for uncertainty associated with estimating by determining an optimistic (best case, represented by O), most likely (represented by M), and pessimistic (worst case, represented by P) scenario. 
The most likely estimate is weighted most heavily.
The equation is **(O + 4M + P) / 6**

***Bottom-up estimating***	
Used when there is significant detail about the activity. 
A detailed assessment of the resources, capabilities, and amounts are used to determine an accurate duration or cost estimate. 
This is the most accurate method but also the most time-consuming and expensive form of estimating.

* * *

## Common cause Vs Special cause
There are always variances for the results from a process over time. The results are to be plotted on a control chart. 
It is divided into two category: Common Cause and Special Cause.

**Common Cause**: the normal variances for every process which in random in nature — inherit in the process (life is not perfect)

***Common cause is normal and cannot be elimiated***
On a control chart, common cause variations would have the pattern of:
all points within the control limits
points distributed randomly on both sides of the average value
Common cause variance is also known as **random cause** — i.e. there is not a special reason for the variation
The process in question is considered as stable

**Special Cause**: causes that are **NOT inherent in the process**
Special cause indicates that there may be *some sort of defects* in the process and the cause of the variance needs to be dug out
Special cause can usually be resolved with adjustments to the processes, components or methods
On a control chart, special cause variations would have the pattern of either:
a point or more beyond the control limits
some trends of the points (e.g. more than 5 consecutive points on one side of the average value
Special cause is also know as assignable cause — that can be attributed to some special reasons

* * *

## Avoid vs Mitigate
**Avoid**: to completely eliminate the likelihood / impact of the risks
**Mitigate**: to reduce the impacts / the likelihood of occurrence of the risks
**Enhance** will increase the % of occurrence of the opportunity or to increase the benefits from the realization of the opportunities
**Exploit** will make the occurrence 100%

**For negative risks:**
	
- Mitigate
- Avoid
- Transfer
- Accept
- Escalate

**For positive risks (i.e. opportunities):**

- Enhance
- Exploit
- Share
- Accept

**Avoid**: 
taking any possible ***measures/actions*** (e.g. changing the project plan or approach) to completely prevent the risks from occurring/eliminate the adverse effects once they occur not many risks may be avoided (not realistic for most cases)
***avoid usually involves a lot of costs***
**Mitigate**: taking measures/actions (e.g. changing the project plan or approach) to reduce the likelihood of the risks from occurring/minimize the impact once they occur
some residual risks may remain
In addition, there are three more **negative risk management strategies** as outlined in the PMBOK® Guide:

**Transfer**: 
the negative impacts related to the occurrence of the risk are shifted to a 3rd party
the 3rd party will absorb all the losses may be arranged in the form of insurance policy or penalty clause usually involve contractual arrangements and considerations

**Accept:** 
the negative risks are to be accepted passively
no active actions / measures are carried out to reduce the likelihood of occurrence / degree of negative impact which might be caused by the occurrence of the risk
workarounds may be carried out as a response once the risks occur

**Escalate**: 
escalate the project risk to the appropriate party to handle it
no longer a responsibility of the project manager
can be deleted from the risk register or leave it there with a remark

* * *

**Enhance vs Exploit**
**Enhance**: 
taking ***measures/actions*** (e.g. changing the project plan or approach) to increase the probability of the occurrence of opportunities / increase the benefits from the opportunities note that the opportunities **may not realize in the end**
may be considered as the **opposite of “mitigation”** in negative risk response strategy

**Exploit**: 
taking any possible actions to make sure the opportunities will realize
do everything to realize the opportunities, including adding budgets or carrying out dramatic actions
may be considered as the **opposite of “avoid”** in negative risk response strategy

* * *

## Contingency Plan Vs Fallback plan
**Contingency Plan**: the pre-developed risk response strategies to be taken if the actively accepted risks occur
**Fallback Plan**: the pre-developed risk response strategies to be taken if the primary risk response is not effective
- to be taken after the Contingency Plan
- for identified risks (known unknowns)
- developed during Plan Risk Responses process

* * *
**Accepted Deliverable vs Verified Deliverable vs Validated Deliverable**
**Verified Deliverable**: Output from project tasks that meets by quality control measures as specified in Quality Management Plan; an output of the Control Quality (Project Quality Management)
**Accepted Deliverable**: The verified deliverables from perform quality control that have been approved by the Customer / Stakeholders to fulfil the acceptance criteria; an output of Validate Scope (Project Scope Management) 
***Ghar Painting***
**Updates**
Validated Deliverable to Verified Deliverable
Validate scope to Verified Scope
* * *
**Verification vs Validation**
**Verification**: a quality control process to ensure the deliverables meet the regulation, requirements, specifications, etc.
According to the PMBOK® Guide 5th Edition: Verification is “the evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system compiles with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is ***often an internal process***”.
**Validation**: the acceptance process by customers / stakeholders to formally acknowledge the deliverables meet their requirements.
According to the PMBOK® Guide 5th Edition: Validation is “the assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often ***involves acceptance*** and suitability with ***external customers***”.

* * *
Quality: a measure of how the product conforms to the requirement / fit for the expected use level.
If the product has high quality, it should meet the quality requirements set out in the production specification and is fit for the uses as described. However, if it doe not, it is said to have low quality.
Grade: a measure of which level the product is expected to perform.
If the product is low grade, it is intended / designed to be used on an everyday condition than in extreme cases.
Which is important?
A product with low grade is acceptable since it fulfils its intended functions and expectations (e.g. less features) probably at a lower cost.
A product with low quality is a problem, since it does not meet the requirements and expectations (e.g. breaks down easily).
A high quality product will always meet your expectations while a low quality product won’t.

* * *
## Statement of Work (SOW) vs Project Scope Statement
**Statement of Work (SOW)** : is also known as Project Statement of Work is a document including the high level description of the intended deliverables of the project.
**Project Scope Statement**: a document ***including more details than Project Statement of Work on the scope*** and deliverables of the project, major assumptions and constraints are also added if appropriate.

Statement of Work (SOW) contains **high level information** of the project deliverables
Project Scope Statement contains **more details** of the deliverables plus assumptions and constraints
Illustrated Example
Statement of Work (SOW) contains at least the following three elements:

- Organization strategic plan
- Business needs
- High level product scope

Project Scope Statement on the other hands includes lots of details for the project (not necessarily include all of the following):

- objectives
- project scope
- product scope
- requirements
- boundaries
- deliverables
- acceptance criteria
- constraints
- assumptions
- milestones
- cost estimation
- specifications
- configuration management requirements
- approval requirements
- etc.

The Project Scope Statement may be ***elaborated progressively over time*** when more details on requirements and constraints are known during the requirements collection and scope defining processes.

Note also that the ***Project Scope Statement together with Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary form the Scope Baseline***.

Which Comes First?

1. Project Statement of Work (SOW) – documenting the very first ideas for the project
1. Project Charter – formally authorising the project and project manager (= SOW + Business Case + Contract)
1. Project Scope Statement – when the project manager is collecting requirements and defining scope

**Project Statement of Work (SOW) vs Procurement Statement of Work (SOW)**
As its name suggest, the Procurement Statement of Work is to be created during Project Procurement Management. It contains ***enough detail to allow potential sellers to decide whether they are qualified or beneficial*** to pursue the project work. The Procurement Statement of Work includes the following elements:

- performance (describe what can be accomplished)
- functional (convey the end purpose or result)
- design (convey precisely what are to be done)
The Procurement Statement of Work may be developed by either the seller or buyer. You will just need to remember that the Project Statement of Work (SOW) is mostly intended for internal use while the **Procurement Statement of Work (SOW) is for always for external use**.

* * *
## Corrective Actions vs Preventive Actions
**Corrective Actions** : these are actions taken when the ***project deviates*** from the scope, schedule, cost or quality plan in order to bring the project performance ***back to the baselines***. 
Corrective actions are reactive actions.
These are actions taken when **non-conformances** have already been detected to ***rectify the cause*** of the issue.
**Preventive Actions**: these are actions taken when the project ***is likely to trend away*** from the scope, schedule, cost or quality plan to ensure the project performance is aligned to the baselines. 
Preventive actions are proactive actions.

Which is Preferred?
Given PMI always ***prefers*** the project managers to be **proactive** in their roles, preventive actions are always preferred. Project Managers should work hard to anticipate and identify any likely occurrence of issues through proactive measures and respond promptly to prevent it from ever occurring.

Preventive actions will ensure the project to proceed smoothly and follow the baselines closely.

Corrective Actions, Preventive Actions and Defect Repairs
**Defect repairs** are actions taken when the deliverable does not meet the agreed quality requirements if the deliverable can still be rectified. Otherwise, a complete rework is needed to create the deliverables from scratches. Both defect repairs and rework ***impose a high cost*** of quality to the project and are least preferred. Prevention has the lowest cost of quality.

* * *

## Assumptions vs Constraints vs Requirements

**Assumptions**: these are factors that are used in the planning process to allow plans to be created with ***reasonable details*** (since without those assumptions, forecasts and budgets cannot be made). Assumptions are reasonably ***believed to be true*** based on experience (e.g. lessons learned), knowledge or information at hand.
Assumptions are needed for estimating the scope, schedule, costs, etc. during the project planning and are well documented in project management plans.
The ***risks of false assumptions*** are dealt with during ***risk management*** planning. If the assumptions would adversely affect the project if found to be false, the assumptions would be documented as risks for risk management.
After completion of the project, the project management will need to assess the accuracy of assumptions and document any findings in lessons learned.
**Constraints**: these are factors that ***need to be taken into accounts*** when planning the project. Constraints are ***mostly restrictions imposed*** on the project. However, with good planning, constraints can be a real benefit to boost effectiveness and efficiency.
Project managers and the team need to work within the constraints of the project in order to achieve project success. Managing the constraints is one core responsibility of the project manager.
In traditional project management, there is the "triple constraint"/"iron triangle" (i.e. three most significant restrictions on any project: ***scope, schedule and cost***). However in the PMBOK® Guide, constraints include a total of 6 competing project constraints:
**Scope** – what are required/expected of the project?
**Time** – when will the project need to be finished?
**Cost** – how much money is provided?
**Quality** – what is the expectation of the outcome? high or just okay?
**Resources** – who are the working team members? what equipment/materials are provided?
**Risk** – what can go wrong with the project and how to deal with them?

These constraints on the project are interrelated, change in one constrain will affect some/all the others. 

**Requirements:** these are features/capabilities/products/deliverables that  expected to be delivered from the project as interim or end results.
Requirements focus on the capability of the deliverable rather than the project itself.
 
Eg - Design of hybrid car

* * *

## Quality Control vs Quality Assurance
**Quality Control**: quality control is in the “***monitoring and controlling process group***” and is concerned with the ***activities and measures*** taken ***to achieve quality requirements*** (as in the Control Quality process).
In simpler words, Quality Control is concerned with the ***quality of the “products/deliverables“***. Its major aim is to ensure the correctness of and check for defects in the products/deliverables.
Quality Control is a ***“reactive” process*** to inspect the products/deliverables to detect any non-conformance in them.
Quality Control is used to verify the quality of the product.
**Quality Assurance:** quality assurance is in the “**executing process group**” and is a ***process-based approach*** to ***ensure*** the ***processes and methodology associated*** with the production of the final deliverables/products ***are defects free*** such that the deliverables/products can fulfil the quality objectives (as in the Manage Quality process).
In simpler words, Quality Assurance is concerned about the “processes“. Its major aim is to avoid defects in products/deliverable at all by assessing the effectiveness of current quality control processes and issue change requests as necessary to correct any defects in the processes.
Quality Assurance is a ***“pro-active” process*** involving understanding the requirements and formulating measures (e.g. ***quality audit, training***, etc.) to achieve the required objectives.
Quality Assurance is used to manage the **quality of the processes.**
As seen from the above, Quality Control and Quality Assurance processes are closely related and interact with each other. The quality assurance process <ins>defines the procedures to carry out quality control</ins>, and feedback from quality control will influence the quality assurance process. Should defects are found from quality control processes, the information would be used by quality assurance processes to determine any corrective/preventive measures that are needed. That’s why “Quality Control Measurements” are an input to the Manage Quality process in the Quality Management process group.

Quality Control would examine the final product against the quality requirements set out in the Quality Management Plan and report as Quality Control Measurements.
Quality Assurance would make use of the Quality Control Measurements and other information to re-assess whether the correct methodology and processes are used in the project and the Quality Control process is looking at the correct/most effective metrics, etc.
* * *

## Contingency Reserve vs Management Reserve
**Contingency Reserve**: contingency reserves are **money added** to the project cost estimates by the project manager for uncertain events / risks that might happen (also known as “**known unknowns**”).
to manage identified risks the amount is calculated based on risk management techniques defined in the risk management plan (e.g.  **Expected Monetary Value (EMV) or Decision Tree Method)**
the project manager has the full authority to make use of the contingency reserve once the risk(s) has/have materialized
contingency reserve is included in the cost baseline (**Cost Baseline = Project Cost Estimate + Contingency Reserve**)
once a risk is not realized, the contingency reserve set aside for that risk would be released
**Management Reserve**: management reserves are money added to the project overall budget by the ***senior management*** for uncertain events that are not even thought of (also known as “**unknown unknowns**”, i.e. risks not shown in the risk register).
to manage unidentified risks (i.e. risks that cannot be identified through the risk management processes)
the amount is based on the organization policies and/or complexity of the project (usually “***guessed***”(not scientifically) at 5 – 15% of the total budget)
the management reserve is controlled by a REPRESENTATIVE from senior management (NOT the project manager), prior approval must be sought before utilizing the reserve on the project management reserve is NOT included in the cost baseline but in the project overall budget (Project Budget = Cost Baseline + Management Reserve)
the management reserve would be kept until the end of the project

Eg - Building construction - earthquake
* * *
## Critical Path Method (CPM) vs Critical Chain Method (CCM)
**Critical Path Method (CPM)**: the Critical Path Method is the most popular scheduling method in the PMP® Exam which involves the calculation of early start **(ES)**, early finish **(EF)**, late start **(LS)** and late finish **(LF)** through forward and backward passes in the project schedule network diagram. This will facilitate the project manager ***to estimate the buffers (floats) or the lack of for individual activities*** on the schedule network path.
The Critical Path Method focuses on the sequence of activities/tasks to allow the project team to ***visualize the overall flow of the tasks.***
**Critical Chain Method (CCM)**: the Critical Chain Method actually ***builds on the Critical Path Method*** by considering the resource ***availabilities*** and their ***dependencies*** along all the task chain and ***adding buffers*** to the end of the chain to account for scarcity of resources in order to ***protect the project schedule*** from slipping. This may result in a new Critical Path to be identified instead of the one found in Critical Path Method.
The Critical Chain Method is derived from the “***Theory of Constraints***”, it focuses on resource availability and dealing with uncertainties/changes.
Instead of micro-managing the schedule of individual activities of the network path with task-based buffers, Critical Chain Method focuses on managing the overall buffer of all the activities on the chain. This will allow the project schedule to be in better control.
If used properly, the Critical Chain Method will achieve HIGHER EFFICIENCY by removing implicit buffers of individual tasks and lower schedule risks.
There are 3 types of buffers:
**Project Buffer**: placed at the end of the project, the project buffer provides contingency for the critical chain activities
**Feeding Buffer**: placed at the end of ***non-critical chains*** in order to match the the duration of critical chain
**Resource Buffer**: placed ***on the critical chain*** to allow rooms for the designated resources to work on the critical chain tasks
Illustrated Example
The following is a simplified diagram to illustrate Critical Path Method vs Critical Chain Method:

**The Critical Path Method** allows the project team to easily visualize the sequence of tasks and the estimated duration of individual tasks in a straight-forward manner, something most people are familiar with. However, since there are no overall buffers to be added to the critical path, project ***team members may***, while ***estimating*** for the duration of individual tasks, try to ***add “implicit buffers”*** conservatively to ***each task*** with a view to protect the overall schedule. This may result in “too much” buffers added to the critical path and make the estimation not efficient. The project manager need to monitor closely the progress of individual tasks as one task progresses at a slower than expected pace will adversely affect the whole project schedule.
**The Critical Chain Method**, on the other hand, just put the tasks together in a chain by considering the minimal time needed for individual tasks. An overall “project buffer” is added to the end of the chain which provides some protection against the project schedule. This may result in higher efficiency of the buffer estimation by combining the individual implicit buffer for an explicit buffer. Project team members would be able to provide a more aggressive schedule for each tasks as there is an overall buffer to protect the project schedule. The project manager will focus on managing the overall buffer during the executing and monitoring processes.
Summary
How to tell whether the PMP® Exam question is asking about Critical Path Method or Critical Chain Method? The easiest way is to look carefully for the terms used to describe the network schedule of the project:

Terms used in Critical Path Method:
Forward Pass
Backward Pass
Early Start
Late Start
Early Finish
Late Finish
Slack / Float
Total Slack / Float
Calculate the Duration
Critical Path
Terms used in Critical Chain Method:
Project Buffer
Feeding Buffer
Resources Buffer
Critical Chain
resource constraints
By looking for the above terms, Aspirants will be able to distinguish between Critical Path Method and Critical Chain Method and tackle the questions correctly.
* * *
Work Package vs Activity
The Work Package is the lowest level in the sense that meaningful estimation of cost and duration for the scope of work included can be achieved.
Activity: an activity is a small enough unit of work that needs to be carried out to fulfil the project scope.
The Work Package is further decomposed into activities (which are to be entered into the “Activity List”).
The activity list is to be used to develop the project schedule.
Every activity has a start and end day (duration), there may be some sort of logical relationship between the activities.
* * *

## Cost of Quality: Cost of Conformance vs Cost of Non-conformance
**Cost of Conformance**: this is the costs incurred by carrying out activities to ensure the project and deliverables conform to the quality requirements and avoid failure (i.e. building quality into the project processes).
Cost of Conformance can be broadly divided into two categories:
**Prevention Costs** — 
money spent on activities/equipment to prevent defects from arising in the first place, e.g. :

- Equipment update and maintenance
- Training provided to staff
- Documentation
- Following quality standards
- Time and human resources involved
- Quality Assurance activities
 
**Appraisal Costs** — money spent on those activities to inspect and dig out defects to prevent these defects from getting into the hands of the customers, e.g.:

- Testing and inspection
- Destructive testing loss
- Quality Control activities

**Cost of Non-Conformance**: this is the money that needs to be spent for not conforming to the quality requirements.
Cost of Non-Conformance can also be broadly divided into two categories:
**Internal Failure Costs** — the costs incurred when defects in the deliverables are detected internally (i.e. not yet presented to the customers)
Defect Repair
Rework
**External Failure Costs** — the costs incurred when defects are found the deliverables have been delivered to customers and in actual use (this is the worst kind of quality costs)
Warranty work
Liabilities
Loss of business goodwill
* * *
Residual Risk vs Secondary Risk
Residual Risk: the risk(s) that remains after carrying out the risks response or those risks that are accepted without any risk responses (maybe the cost for the risk response is more than the cost of dealing with it)
residual risks must be identified and documented during the risk management process
a contingency reserve should be set up to tackle these risks should these kinds of risks arise
Secondary Risk: the risk(s) that are created directly owing to the implementation of a risk response for primary risks
since every activity involves risks — the risk responses themselves are no exception, implementation of a risk response will result in new risks for the project
a risk response plan would need to be planned and implemented to tackle this kind of risks
secondary risks may be accepted without further actions if their impact are small on the overall project objectives

* * *
Common Cause vs Special Cause
Common Cause: the normal variances for every process which in random in nature — inherit in the process (life is not perfect)
Common cause is normal and cannot be elimiated
On a control chart, common cause variations would have the pattern of:
all points within the control limits
points distributed randomly on both sides of the average value
Common cause variance is also known as random cause — i.e. there is not a special reason for the variation
The process in question is considered as stable
Special Cause: causes that are NOT inherent in the process
Special cause indicates that there may be some sort of defects in the process and the cause of the variance needs to be dug out
Special cause can usually be resolved with adjustments to the processes, components or methods
On a control chart, special cause variations would have the pattern of either:
a point or more beyond the control limits
some trends of the points (e.g. more than 5 consecutive points on one side of the average value
Special cause is also know as assignable cause — that can be attributed to some special reasons
* * *
Crashing vs Fast Tracking
Crashing: crashing is a schedule compression technique to shorten the activity duration by adding extra resources (money and/or human resources)
involves additional costs as extra resources are needed for
overtime
extra manpower
outsourcing
normally to be explored after Fast Tracking
Project Manager needs to judge which activities can be “crashed” with the lowest cost for the maximum effectiveness
may create risks for rework/defects
Fast Tracking: is a schedule compression technique to perform activities in parallel (partial or in whole) in order to save time
the activities to be performed in parallel should be analyzed for logical relationship and that the two activities in question can really be carried our in parallel (i.e. overlapping of part or the whole activities)
normally no extra resources are needed
additional risks may be created
Fast Tracking is the preferred method for schedule compression
Both Fast Tracking and Crashing must be applied to activities on the Critical Path in order to really shorten the project duration. When applied on activities not on the critical path, it would only increase Floats which will not shorten the project duration (note: the Critical Path may be different when there are delays to activities of the project).
* * *
Control Limit vs Specification Limit
Aspirants would need to remember Control Limits are there to indicate whether the process/system is under control or not. Results falling outside the Control Limits would mean the process is unstable and root cause analysis is needed. Specification Limits are imposed by agreement with customers on strictly quality requirements, i.e. Specification Limits must be within the Control Limits.

* * *
Cost Baseline vs Budget
Cost Baseline: Cost Baseline is the authorized time-phased spending plan for the project on which the project cost performance is to be measured against. As the Cost Baseline is baselined and managed under configuration management, changes to the Cost Baseline must undergo proper change management processes.
The Cost Baseline includes all the project activities/resources costs and the money set aside to respond to risks identified (i.e. known unknowns) over time and it is usually represented as an S-curve
Cost Baseline = Project Cost Estimates + Contingency Reserves
Cost Budget: the allowable deviations requested based on customer expectations
The Cost Budget is the estimate of total amount of money required for carrying out the Project, including money set aside for identified and unidentified risks (i.e. unknown unknowns)
The Cost Budget can be thought of as the Cost Baseline over time plus the Management Reserves
Cost Budget = Project Cost Estimates + Contingency Reserves + Management Reserves
Cost Baseline vs Budget for PMP® Exam Illustrated

Fallback vs Workaround
Fallback and Workaround
Fallback: a fallback plan is a plan developed to deal with risks that have been identified during project planning
for identified risks
known unknowns
Workaround: a workaround is the unplanned response the Project Manager need to take to deal with emerging risks and risks that are passively accepted as the risk response during project execution (i.e. there are no pre-determined risk response plan in place)
for unidentified risks or risks that are passively accepted (note: risks that are accepted actively will be dealt with a Fallback)
unknown unknowns
Note: Risks can be either accepted actively or passively:

active acceptance means the identified risk is accepted without any response to reduce or eliminate the chance of occurrence but measures are planned (i.e. fallback) to deal with it once it occurs
passive acceptance means the identified risk is accepted without any response altogether (maybe the chance of occurrence is too low or the effect too minimal), just wait and see if workaround is needed once it occurs.

## Free Float vs Total Float
**Free Float**: the amount of time (float) an activity on the schedule network diagram can be freely delayed ***without affecting the early start of the of following/successor activity***
for activities ***NOT*** on the critical path
Free Float can only be ***non-zero*** when two or more activities have a common successor activity
**Free Float = ES of successor activity – EF**
where ES = Early Start, EF = Early Finish

**Total Float**: the total amount of time (float) an activity on the schedule network diagram **can be delayed** without ***affecting the project finish date***
for activities NOT on the critical path
**Total Float = LF – EF (or LS – ES)**
where ES = Early Start, EF = Early Finish, LS = Late Start, LF = Late Finish

Note the following:

Activities on the Critical Path have ***ZERO free float or total float***. 
Total Float and Free Float for an activity may be the same or different depending on the other activities in the schedule diagram.
When you are asked to calculate the “Float” for an activity in the PMP® Exam, you are asked to calculate the “Total Float“.

**Product Quality**: product quality is the adherence/conformance of the product/deliverable of the project to the pre-defined requirements/standards.
Product Quality can be improved and guaranteed by ***quality control and quality assurance***
**Quality control**: concerned with the activities and measures taken to achieve quality requirements
**Quality assurance**: a process based approach to ensure the ***processes and methodology*** associated with the production of the final deliverables/products ***are defect free***
**Project Quality**: project quality is concerned about the ***management and implementation*** of the ***project processes*** to turn the project requirements into project deliverables
Project Quality is assessed by carrying audit on the project management practices (which is outside the scope of the PMBOK® Guide, somewhat performed by the role of Project Assurance in PRINCE2®)

**Project Team**: The Project Team is a collective term describing all the people that are ***involved*** to work on the project, from ***planning, executing to closing***.
The Project Team ***includes the Project Management Team.***
Other sub-sets in the project team may include: design team, speciality teams.
In small projects, the whole team may be responsible for project management and there is NOT a single Project Management Team defined.
**Project Management Team**: The Project Management Team is responsible for the project management and ***leadership activities*** such as: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling and closing of the project/project phases.
The Project Management Team is a subset of the Project Team, including the Project Manager.
The Project Management Team is NOT responsible for executing out the project.
The Project Management Team is also known as the core, executive or leadership team.
Note: In PRINCE2®, the Project Management Team includes senior users, senior suppliers and the project sponsor/executive in addition to the project manager, this is different from the definition of PMBOK® Guide

**Discrete Effort**: Discrete Effort is work that can be planned and measured with specific output also known as “***Measurable Effort***”
the work can be directly associated with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) component and can be measured with percentage of progress
**Non-discrete Effort**: Opposite of Discrete Effort, further divided into two types:

- ***Apportioned Effort***: Apportioned Effort is work which cannot be divided into discrete efforts and ***is allotted proportionately to other discrete effort(s)***. the work is directly associated with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) component/deliverable, usually cannot be separated from the discrete efforts
Apportioned Effort supports Discrete Efforts and therefore its ***earned value is directly proportional to the discrete effort***
e.g. ***inspection, quality assurance, verification, validation activities***
**Level of Effort (LoE)**: Level of Effort is supportive work that do not produce definitive output but is ***measured with (passage of) time***. the work is not associated with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) component/deliverable
Level of Effort activities support an activity or the whole project
usually consists of short duration of ***work repeated periodically throughout the project***
Level of Effort activities ***cannot be put in the critical path*** as they do not add time to the project duration
Level of Effort activities are included to reflect the resource requirements of activities without deliverables, such as:
***project management, meetings, administrative work, accounting,*** maintenance
